@; generic interface ----------------------------------------------------------
@section{Generic Graph Interface}

@defthing[gen:graph any/c]{
  A @tech{generic interface} (see @secref["struct-generics"]) that defines a @deftech{graph}. To supply method implementations, a struct should use the @racket[#:methods] form. A @tech{graph} has the following methods:

@itemize[
 
  @item{@racket[has-vertex?]: Accepts two arguments, a graph and a vertex. Indicates whether the vertex is in the graph.}
  @item{@racket[has-edge?]: Accepts threes arguments, a graph and two vertices. Indicates whether the edge is in the graph.}
  @item{@racket[add-vertex!]: Accepts two arguments, a graph and a vertex. Imperatively adds the vertex to the graph.}
  @item{@racket[add-edge!]: Accepts three or four arguments, a graph, two vertices, and an optional weight value. Imperatively adds the undirected edge comprised of the two vertices and the optional weight to the graph.}
  @item{@racket[add-directed-edge!]: Accepts three or four arguments, a graph, source and destination vertices, and an optional weight value. Imperatively adds to the graph the directed, optionally weighted edge going from the source to the destination.}
  @item{@racket[in-vertices]: Accepts one argument, a graph. Returns a list whose elements are the vertices of the graph.}
  @item{@racket[in-neighbors]: Accepts two arguments, a graph and a vertex. Returns a sequence whose elements are the vertex's neighbors in the graph.}
  @item{@racket[in-edges]: Accepts one argument, a graph. Returns a sequence whose elements are the edges of the graph.}
  @item{@racket[edge-weight]: Accepts three arguments, a graph and two vertices. Returns the weight of the edge in the graph (if it has one).}
  ]
}

@defproc[(graph? [g any/c]) boolean?]{
  Returns @racket[#t] if @racket[g] is a @tech{graph} (ie, implements @racket[gen:graph]) and @racket[#f] otherwise.

 Standard textbook breadth-first search, ie as in CLRS. Takes two arguments, a graph and a source vertex. Returns two values, a hash table mapping a vertex to the distance (in terms of number of vertices) from the source, and a hash table mapping a vertex to its predecessor in the search.}

Generalized breadth-first search. Partially inspired by the C++ Boost Graph Library. See Lee et al. OOPSLA 1999 @cite["GGCL"]. Here is the rough implementation:
@racketblock[  
  (init G s)
  (enqueue! Q s)
  (mark-discovered! s)
  (for ([u (in-queue Q)])
    (visit G s u)
    (for ([v (in-neighbors G u)] #:when (visit? G s u v) #:break (break?))
      (mark-discovered! v)
      (discover G s u v)
      (enqueue! Q v)))
  (finish G s)]
Utilizes a queue that implements @racket[gen:queue]. A vertex is @deftech{discovered} when it gets added to the queue. If no @racket[custom-visit?-fn] is provided, then the function does not visit vertices that have already been discovered. When a vertex is dequeued, then @racket[visit] is called. The result of @racket[bfs/generalized] is the result of @racket[finish].}
