Cleaner syntax for @racket[bfs/generalized]. Essentially, this form eliminates the need to define separate functions and then pass them into @racket[bfs/generalized]'s keyword arguments. Instead, the bodies of those functions are inserted right after the corresponding keywords.
                   
For example, below is Dijkstra's algorithm, implemented with @racket[do-bfs]. In the code, @racket[d] is a hash mapping a vertex to the intermediate shortest distance from the source and @racket[Ï] is a hash mapping a vertex to its predecessor in the shortest path from the source. The algorithm utilizes a priority queue that is sorted according to intermediate shortest paths. A node is "visited" when it improves one of the paths.

@racketblock[
(define (dijkstra G s) 
  (define-hashes d Ï)
  (define (w u v) (edge-weight G u v))

  (do-bfs G s #:init-queue (mk-empty-priority (Î» (u v) (< (d u) (d v))))
    #:init
      (for ([v (in-vertices G)]) (d-set! v +inf.0) (Ï-set! v #f))
      (d-set! s 0)
    #:visit? (to from) (> (d from) (+ (d to) (w to from)))
    #:discover (to from)
      (d-set! from (+ (d to) (w to from)))
      (Ï-set! from to)
    #:return (values d Ï)))]

The @racket[#:visit] clause binds two identifiers, representing the searched nodes and @racket[#:discover] is similar. This form is somewhat brittle since @racket[#:init] and @racket[#:return] don't bind any ways and instead @racket[G] and @racket[s] are captured from the context but this hasnt been a problem in practice.

@racket[bfs], @racket[fewest-vertices-path], @racket[mst-prim], and @racket[dijkstra] all use this form.}

Generalized depth-first search. Partially inspired by the C++ Boost Graph Library. See Lee et al. OOPSLA 1999 @cite["GGCL"]. Here is the rough implementation:
@racketblock[  
  (init G)

          [(process-unvisited? G #f u) (process-unvisited G #f u)]))
  
  (finish G)]
The @racket[do-visit] function is the inner loop that keeps following edges depth-first until the search gets stuck. The "visit" part of the code is separated into two functions, the @racket[prologue], which represents the descending part of the visit, and @racket[epilogue], which gets called on the way back up. The outer @racket[for] loop picks a new start to restart the search when it gets stuck. Nodes that are already visited are marked and are not searched again. The algorithm terminates when all nodes are visited. The result of @racket[dfs/generalized] is the result of @racket[finish]. 

The @racket[order] function is a sorting function that specifies where to start the search and @racket[break] aborts the search and returns when it is true. @racket[process-unvisited?] and @racket[process-unvisited] specify code to run when a node is not visited.}

Analogous to @racket[do-bfs]. Nicer syntax for @racket[dfs/generalized]. Below is @racket[dag?] as an example, which indicates whether a graph is directed and acyclic.

Encountering a gray node while searching indicates a cycle, so the function keeps track of a flag that is set when a gray node is seen, and the @racket[#:break] function returns the value of this flag, terminating the search as soon as a cycle is found.

Graph coloring functions are only valid for undirected graphs.

@section{Graph Coloring}

@defproc[(coloring [g graph?] [num-colors natural-number/c] [#:order order (-> list? list?) (Î» (x) x)])
         (or/c (hash/c any/c number? #:immutable #f) #f)]{
Returns a coloring for the given graph using at most the specified number of colors, or @racket[#f] if no coloring is possible. Uses backtracking algorithm so takes exponential time. Optional @racket[#:order] parameter determines the order in which verticies are colored.}
                                                                                        
@defproc[(coloring/greedy 
          [g graph?] 
          [#:order order (or/c 'smallest-last (-> list? list?)) 'smallest-last])
         (values number? (hash/c any/c number? #:immutable #f))]{
Returns a "greedy" coloring of the given graph, where the color for a vertex is the "smallest" color not used by one of its neighbors (or the number of colors is increased).

The function always returns a valid coloring but the optimality (ie number of colors used) depends on the ordering in which the vertices are considered. The default is to use "smallest-last" ordering (see @racket[order-smallest-last]) but if @racket[#:order] is a procedure, then it is applied to sort the list of vertices before the coloring begins.

Only works on undirected graphs.

The returned "colors" are numbers starting from 0. The function also returns the total number of colors used.}

@defproc[(coloring/brelaz [g graph?]) (hash/c any/c number? #:immutable #f)]{
Returns a "greedy" coloring of the given graph, using the Brelaz vertex ordering heuristic. Note that this function is separate from @racket[coloring/greedy] because the ordering is determined in an online manner.}
          
@defproc[(order-smallest-last [g graph?]) list?]{
Consumes a graph and returns the vertices of the graph in "smallest-last" order. The ordering proceeds as follows. The vertex with the smallest degree is last. Then that vertex is removed and the degrees of the remaining vertices are updated. Then the second to last vertex has the lowest remaining degree and so on.

Only works for undirected graphs.}
                                                                
@defproc[(valid-coloring? [g graph?] [coloring (hash/c any/c number?)]) boolean?]{
Indicates whether the given coloring (a hash that maps a vertex to a color) is valid, meaning that no edge has two vertices of the same color.

This function assumes that a "color" is a number and uses @racket[=] to compare colors.}

@; max flow -------------------------------------------------------------------
@section{Maximum Flow}
@defproc[(maxflow [g graph?] [source any/c] [sink any/c])
         (hash/c (list/c any/c any/c) number?)]{
Computes the maximum flow in graph @racket[g] from @racket[source] to @racket[sink] using the Edmonds-Karp algorithm, which runs in time O(VE^2). Edmonds-Karp is an improvement on the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm in that it uses @racket[fewest-vertices-path] to find an augmenting path in each iteration.
                                   
The function returns a hash mapping an edge to a non-negative number representing the flow along that edge. The returned returned flow is maximal and obeys a few properties:
@itemize[@item{The flow out of the source equals the source into the sink.}
         @item{The flow out of each non-source/sink vertex equals the flow into that vertex.}
         @item{The flow along each edge is <= the edge's capacity (ie, weight).}]
                                   
This function should only be used on directed graphs, otherwise things get double counted.}
                                               
@defproc[(bipartite? [g graph?]) (or/c #f (list/c list? list?))]{
  Determines whether a graph is bipartite using a @racket[dfs]-based 2-@racket[coloring], thus runs in linear time. Returns @racket[#f] if the graph is not bipartite (ie, not 2-colorable), and other wise returns a list of two lists, where each sublist is the "left" and "right" sets of vertices, respectively, in the bipartite graph.}

@defproc[(maximum-bipartite-matching [g graph?]) (listof (list/c any/c any/c))]{
  Returns a list of edges representing the maximum matching of the given bipartite graph. An error is raised if the given graph is not bipartite. Uses @racket[maxflow] to compute the maximum matching.

Note: this is not the Hopcroft-Karp (ie fastest) bipartite matching algorithm.}

@section{Other Useful Graph Functions}
@defproc[(graphviz [g graph?] [#:colors colors boolean? #f]) string?]{
Returns the dotfile representation of the given graph (as a string).}
