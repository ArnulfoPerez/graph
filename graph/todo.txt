- either eliminate graph-matrix.rkt
      or
  implement in-neighbors, etc properly
- refactor fns-allpairs-shortestpaths so that the Ls store functions instead of
  hashes --- enables better use of generics
- compute \Pi for floyd-warshall
- state somewhere that floyd warshall requires all self-edges to be 0 and no
  negative weight cycles
- implement max flow algorithms
- refactor dfs and related fns to take a "visitor" function
